# Song Scraper

`This is a program to be executed by a human, with some help from computers.`  


### A Little Setup
1. Make sure the local copy of the `shapes.sqlite` database is up to date.
1. Point the sqlite CLI to the database with (for example):
```
sqlite3 /Users/davidforrest/david_local/development_local/Shapes-API/www/shapes.sqlite
```

### List of Sources

To list all recurring sources currently in the database:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT parent_entity, parent_stream
FROM source
ORDER BY parent_entity;
```
