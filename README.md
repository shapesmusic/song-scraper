# Song Scraper

`This is a program to be executed by a human, with some help from computers.`

### A Little Setup

1. Make sure the local copy of the `shapes.sqlite` database is up to date.
1. Point the sqlite CLI to the database with (for example):

```
sqlite3 /Users/davidforrest/david_local/development_local/shapes-backend/db/shapes.sqlite
```

### List of Sources

To list all recurring sources currently in the database:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT parent_entity, parent_stream
FROM source
ORDER BY parent_entity;
```
